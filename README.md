The Quiz App, a creation of MDA Raju during the CodSoft Internship, offers an engaging user experience. 
It presents two distinct quiz modes: 
→ The first being a fun and standard quiz, where points are awarded for correct answers. 
→ The second mode, the Challenge, adopts a different approach by deducting points for incorrect answers. 
Users are provided with their scores upon quiz completion, enhancing the interactive nature of the app.

Best regards,
